Step 1: Enable "Less Secure Apps" or Use an App Password
Less Secure Apps: If you haven't already, you may need to allow "less secure apps" to access your Google account. You can do this by going to your Google Account settings, but note that Google may disable this feature in the future.

App Passwords: Alternatively, for better security, it's recommended to use an App Password. You can generate an App Password by following these steps:

Go to your Google Account.
Navigate to Security > Signing in to Google > App Passwords.
Generate an App Password for "Mail" and "Other" (you can name it something like "Python Script").

Step 2: Updated Python Script for Gmail
- Put your sender email and recipients with the password generated in the step above.
- In line 58 change the path from 'Desktop' to the location you want your computer to store the csv file.
